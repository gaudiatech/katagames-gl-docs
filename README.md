# Repo for katagames general documentation

_(!) work-in-progress_

This repo is meant to store the general/global documentation for all users:
kengi users, players who use [KATA.GAMES](https://kata.games), game developers, and so on.

## Can I improve the documentation? How?
 
Improve the documentation via Pull Requests would be very benefical to the project!
Here is how you can build the docs by yourself:
* checkout files of the current repo using `git` 
* using `pip`, install `mkdocs` and `mkdocs-static-i18n`
* using the terminal, navigate to the folder `docs/`
* type `python -m mkdocs build` this will create a set of file in `site/` that can be interpreted by the navigator
* type `python -m mkdocs serve` this will run a very basic server so files can be accessed via HTTP
* simply open the browser, type `127.0.0.1` in the address bar.


## How to get involved without writing the documentation?

- Join our Discord and use the wiki hosted in this repo!
(Feel free to ask for perms via Discord so you could modify the wiki)
- Create issues to describe bugs you detect in the pre-alpha, describe it in the most precise way;
- etc.
